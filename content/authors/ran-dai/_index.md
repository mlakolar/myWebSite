# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Ran Dai is a fourth-year PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Chicago advised by Rina Foygel Barber. Ran's research interest is in high dimensional inference, nonparametric modeling, and shape-constrained regressions, multiple testing, and causal inference. In particular, Ran is interested in developing computationally efficient algorithms for these problems with statistical convergence guarantee and valid inference; and applying these methods towards real datasets in the areas of drug development, HIV mutation study and cancer study.
